    <p class="words"> Hi I'm Lacy and I'm learning to build websites! A little bit about me: I did my undergrad in neuroscience, specifically behavioral. 
      It was really hard but a lot of fun. I've worked in biology, psychology and neuroscience labs, and even presented some of my own original research at several conferences.
      I've also spent an extensive amount of time in live-in and facility nursing- I think that developing a good bedside manner is key to being a quality clinician.
      I love being a student and always learning new things! Now I'm learning web development- I hope to work in cognitive software engineering when I graduate. 
      Wish me luck in learning to code!
